# Wordler
Wordler is an application that tells you the specific wordle answer for that day!

If you do not know what wordle is, it is a game on nytimes.com where you have to guess a 5 letter word, if a letter is yellow, than it is somewhere in the word, if a letter is grey, it is no-where in the word, and if the letter is green, then it is in the exact spot of the word. (By the way, here is the link to play it on nytimes.com: nytimes.com: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
